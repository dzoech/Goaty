# Goaty üêê

Goaty is a Microsoft Teams bot that matches you with coworkers for a quick water cooler conversation based on mutual interests and digital well-being. 

Goaty was our submission for the hackathon [START Hack 2021](https://www.starthack.eu/)

## What is GOATY?

Feeling alone during work from home?
Having no one to talk, but dont wannt to interrupt anybody?
Having only yourself to interact with?

But WAIT.... HERE COMES GOATY
GOATY matches work colleagues based on their individual interests.
GOATY knows when you need a break, or haven't talked to anyone all day.

Goaty integrates seamlessly into Microsoft Teams, on of most popular collaboration platform.
It allows each employee to choose their topics they would like to talk about.

You can also select a preferred time slot where GOATY might send you an invitation to chat with others.
GOATY finds some matching users for a certain topic. If the time is right for a couple of colleagues, GOATY sends each of them a news article as an icebreaker for the conversation.

Everyone has enough time to read the article and can then join the provided meeting room if they like to.
After the conversation each colleague can give feedback to GOATY to further improve the experience and minimize social anxiety.
